### Instructions:

1. **Install Python**:
   - Ensure Python (version 3.7 or higher) is installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Download the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data) or any dataset that contains ASL images.
   - **Unzip the files** to a suitable directory on your computer. Ensure the unzipped files are organized properly for training and testing purposes.

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Use the following command to install the required Python libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy pandas tensorflow
     ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - The code provides two main options:
     1. **Train the neural network**: Use the MNIST dataset to train a new model.
     2. **Load a pre-existing neural network**: Use a saved model for testing.
   - The script then loads images from the test set and makes predictions on them.

5. **Understand the ASL Mapping**:
   - Refer to the image below for the hand signs corresponding to each alphabet:
